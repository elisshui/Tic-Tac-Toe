# Tic-Tac-Toe
This game is the classic two-person tic tac toe game. It was written in python using pygame. It has a simple graphical user interface that consists of a command bar that tells the players whose turn it is and displays the winner at the end of the game. There are two buttons for exiting the game and reseting the game respectively. When a player wins, a red line is drawn across the winning set of dots or crosses.
