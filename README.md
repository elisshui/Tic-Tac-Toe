<h1 align="center">Creating a two-person tic-tac-toe game (python)</h1>

This game is the classic two-person tic-tac-toe game. It was written in python using pygame. It has a simple graphical user interface that consists of a command bar that tells the players whose turn it is and displays the winner at the end of the game. There are two buttons for exiting the game and reseting the game respectively. When a player wins, a red line is drawn across the winning set of dots or crosses.

| Clicking anywhere on any square places an **X** right in the center of the chosen square. | Players take turns to place markers down. | The winner is shown in the command bar and by the red line. | A draw is shown in the command bar. |

* Players may reset the board using the reset button at any time.
* Players may exit the game by clicking on either the exit button (the top right corner) or the game's orange exit button.
* When the game ends, no more squares can be clicked.
* If a player clicks on a square with a marker, the command bar informs the player than the square has been taken and promts the player to chose another square.
